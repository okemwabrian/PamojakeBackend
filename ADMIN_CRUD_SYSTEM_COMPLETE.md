- **Features**: 
  - Tracks all user actions (login, logout, applications, payments, claims, shares)
  - Stores IP address and user agent
  - Automatic timestamping
  - 13 different activity types

### 2. Complete CRUD Endpoints
- **File**: `admin_panel/crud_views.py`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET/POST /api/admin/crud/applications/` - List/Create applications
  - `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/crud/applications/<id>/` - View/Edit/Delete application
  - `GET/POST /api/admin/crud/payments/` - List/Create payments
  - `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/crud/payments/<id>/` - View/Edit/Delete payment

  - `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/crud/shares/<id>/` - View/Edit/Delete share

### 3. Activity Tracking System
- **File**: `admin_panel/middleware.py`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic logging of user activities
  - IP address tracking
  - User agent tracking
  - Integrated with all major endpoints

### 4. Enhanced Dashboard
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/dashboard/stats/`

  - `GET /api/admin/users/<id>/activities/` - User-specific activities

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Database Changes
```bash
# Migration created and applied
python manage.py makemigrations admin_panel
python manage.py migrate admin_panel
```

### Middleware Integration
```python
# Added to settings.py MIDDLEWARE
'admin_panel.middleware.ActivityLoggingMiddleware',
```

### URL Configuration
```python

path('crud/applications/', admin_applications),
path('crud/payments/', admin_payments),
path('crud/claims/', admin_claims),
path('crud/shares/', admin_shares),
path('activities/', admin_user_activities),
path('dashboard/stats/', admin_dashboard_stats),
```
