## 🔧 Key Backend Changes Made

### Login Serializer (accounts/serializers.py)
```python
# Commented out active user restriction
# if not user.is_active:
#     raise serializers.ValidationError('Account is inactive...')
```

### Applications Access (applications/views.py)
```python
def get_queryset(self):
    if not self.request.user.is_active:
        return Application.objects.none()  # No applications for inactive users
```

### Payment Serializer (payments/serializers.py)
```python
payment_instructions = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
# Returns payment details for all methods
```

### Payments Views (payments/views.py)
```python
@action(detail=False, methods=['post'])
def activation_fee(self, request):
    # Handles activation fee submissions
```

### Document Serializer (documents/serializers.py)
```python
file_url = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
file_type = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
# Enables file viewing in frontend
```
